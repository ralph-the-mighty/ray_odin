Odin port of my old ray tracer (with experimental Mu-like platform layer)

Credits to gingerBill of course for the creation of the wonderful Odin language

Credits to Per Vognsen for the design of his Mu and Noir platform layers, which I intend to follow with my humble PL.

Credits to scratchapixel.com for their excellent 3d graphics tutorials, especially the ray tracing lessons (of course)
